FurnitureBench is the real-world furniture assembly benchmark, which aims at providing a reproducible and easy-to-use platform for long-horizon complex robotic manipulation.

It features
- Long-horizon complex manipulation tasks
- Standardized environment setup
- Python-based robot control stack
- FurnitureSim: a simulated environment
- Large-scale teleoperation dataset (200+ hours)

Please check out our [website](https://clvrai.com/furniture-bench/) for more details.


## FurnitureBench

We elaborate on the real-world environment setup guide and tutorials in our [online document](https://clvrai.github.io/furniture-bench/docs/index.html).


## FurnitureSim

FurnitureSim is a simulator based on Isaac Gym. FurnitureSim works on Ubuntu and Python 3.8+. Please refer to [Installing FurnitureSim](https://clvrai.github.io/furniture-bench/docs/getting_started/installing_furniture_sim.html) and [How to Use FurnitureSim](https://clvrai.github.io/furniture-bench/docs/tutorials/furniture_sim.html) for more details about FurnitureSim.
